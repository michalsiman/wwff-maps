# wwff-maps

This is a web based (PHP and MySQL) apps with maps for Word Wide Flora & Fauna (wwff.co) HAM radio. Generated points of WWFF on maps from mapy.cz, with label with number of WWFF point, name of the point, number of total QSO and date of last activation. Easy and simply - you can choose country of points and you can download a GPX file with points.

First version was generated list of point from TXT file - it is too slow.

Second version is based on MySQL database.

Plan is generate map of points of selected country WITHOUT your own already-activated points.
